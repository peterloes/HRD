There once was a time when to make a PCB in our community was to use CadSoft EAGLE,
a PCB design package which neatly filled the entry level of that category with a free
version for non-commercial designs. Upgrading it to the commercial version was fairly inexpensive,
and indeed that was a path which quite a few designers making the step from hobby project to small
production would take.

Then back in 2017, CadSoft were bought by Autodesk, and their new version 8 of the software changed
its licensing model from purchase to rental. It became a product with a monthly subscription and
an online side, and there began an exodus of users for whom pay-to-play meant too much risk of losing
access to their designs. Now six years later the end has come, as the software behemoth
has announced EAGLE’s final demise after a long and slow decline.



The Future of Autodesk EAGLE: Our Path Forward with Fusion 360 Electronics.

EAGLE Free Subscribers: Fusion 360 for Personal Use is the suggested path forward.
Fusion 360 for Personal Use includes integrated CAD, CAM, and CAE functionality,
up to two schematics, two layers, and a 100mm x 80mm board area.
If you’re looking for more, cost-effective monthly and annual subscription options are available.
